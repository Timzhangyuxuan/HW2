<h2 class="titletop"> About Yuxuan </h2>
<p> 
I'm a 23 years old student at the University of Iowa with Econ and MIS majors. I was born in the capital city of Shandong province, China. If you don't know where it is, imagine drawing a line between Beijing and Shanghai, and the middle point of the line is where I came from. 3 years ago, I travelled thousands of miles to the United States for education, cultural exploration as well as professional advancement. Now I am a senior student that is about to graduate in next May. I feel I will definitely miss this part of my life when I'm gone, although I don't know where I will go to. 
</p>
Having only one year of college life left, I decided I should do something aligns with my passion. As I am "retired" from UI Photography Club, some friends and I have started and running our own photography studio called, Tim's Studio. We aim at providing high quality portrait service for students at a reasonable price. I have added a linked on the navigation bar that will direct you to our Facebook webpage. Check it out and like the page if you will :-)
